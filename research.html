            <h2>Research Areas</h2>
            
            <h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
            <p>
                We develop state-of-the-art computational methods for analyzing, understanding, and generating 
                human language. Our work spans both neural and symbolic approaches to NLP, with particular focus 
                on low-resource languages and dialectal varieties.
            </p>

            <h3>Neuro-Symbolic AI</h3>
            <p>
                Our lab pioneers the integration of neural networks with symbolic reasoning systems. This hybrid 
                approach combines the learning capabilities of deep learning with the interpretability and logical 
                consistency of symbolic AI, enabling more robust and explainable language understanding systems.
            </p>

            <h3>Greek Language Technology</h3>
            <p>
                We specialize in developing NLP resources and tools for Greek and its dialectal varieties, including 
                Cypriot, Pontic, Cretan, and Northern Greek dialects. Our work includes corpus development, 
                benchmark creation, and model fine-tuning for Greek language varieties.
            </p>

            <h3>Computational Semantics</h3>
            <p>
                Our research in formal semantics employs Modern Type Theory and proof-theoretic approaches to 
                natural language meaning. We develop computational models that bridge theoretical linguistics 
                with practical NLP applications.
            </p>

            <h3>Digital Humanities</h3>
            <p>
                We apply computational methods to classical philology and historical linguistics, particularly 
                focusing on ancient Greek texts. Our work includes knowledge graph extraction, automated analysis 
                of historical texts, and tools for digital scholarship.
